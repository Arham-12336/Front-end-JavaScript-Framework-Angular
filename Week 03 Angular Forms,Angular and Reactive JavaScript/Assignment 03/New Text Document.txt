Task 1:

The form is set up with the three fields correctly.

A slider component is included in the form to enable users to submit the rating.

Task 2:

The author field is being properly validated. If incorrect, the user is alerted.

The comment field is being properly validated. If incorrect, the user is alerted.

The submit button is enabled only if the name and comment field are valid.

Task 3:

The preview of the comment has been created on top of the form within the same mdList component as used for the regular comments, but separate from them until the comment is submitted. The comment should line up with the remaining comments.

The comment preview is shown only when the information in the form is valid.

Upon submission of the comment, it gets included in the regular comments and shown on the screen.

The date for the comment has been automatically set upon submission.

Upon successful submission, the form is reset to its default value with the rating set to 5.
